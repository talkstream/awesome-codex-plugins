# Closeout Track — Verify the Plan, Merge the Canon, Accept the Statuses

Plugin runtime asset. Loaded by the `review` skill — this track's primary
executor — when `/archcore:review` routes closeout-shaped wording ("close out
the feature", "ship the feature") here, or when a plain branch review matches
a `plan` covering its diff. Gate
record shape, state rules, and execution rules:
`skills/_shared/gate-contract.md`. Interview mechanics and question budget:
`skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md`. Branch scope:
`skills/_shared/branch-state.md`.

## Track notes

- Gate order: `closeout.verify` → `closeout.merge` → `closeout.accept` →
  `closeout.capture` → `closeout.discharge`.
- Capture and disposal are separate gates on purpose: a declined capture
  leaves a fulfilled plan removable, and a removable plan never forces a
  capture. `closeout.capture` owns no document type of its own — every
  document it creates comes from the instrument it routes to, under that
  instrument's own Produces rules.
- Boundary against the actualize track
  (`skills/_shared/tracks/actualize.md`): actualize detects drift at any
  time; closeout is the completion step for one finished piece of work —
  verify the plan was fulfilled, merge the result into the documents, then
  transition statuses. Drift-shaped wording without a completion signal
  and without a matched `plan` routes to actualize.
- Plain-review entry: the `review` skill enters this track from a plain
  branch review with no completion wording. On that entry, run
  `closeout.verify` first. IF any task or acceptance criterion of the plan
  is not `fulfilled`, THEN skip `closeout.merge`, `closeout.accept`,
  `closeout.capture`, and `closeout.discharge` for that plan, and report
  the remaining work or the missing check.
- Several matched plans: run the full gate sequence once per plan, with
  that plan's chain as the scope. Do not ask again about a document
  already confirmed for an earlier plan in the same invocation.
- Scope: the `plan` document covering the branch work (matched by topic or
  path references), its `implements` and `depends_on` chain one hop (`prd`, `idea`,
  `rnd`, `research`, `spec`), plus every document the branch diff references. The `review`
  skill pre-fills the branch boundary per `skills/_shared/branch-state.md`.
- Before judging completion, inspect the current working tree, including
  staged, unstaged, and untracked files in scope. Use the branch diff and
  available verification reports as evidence; a commit is not a prerequisite.
- The executing skill MUST NOT stage files on this track.
- The executing skill MUST NOT create commits on this track.
- Status rule: this track transitions draft → accepted only, one
  per-document confirmation each; a decline leaves the status unchanged.
  Rejection is not this track's verdict — an `rfc` resolves through
  `decision.resolve` (`skills/_shared/tracks/decision.md`), any other
  rejection stays a direct user edit. A draft that carries an `archcore:track`
  state block is unfinished work: the accept gate skips it without an offer.
  A completed `plan` takes no terminal
  status: `closeout.discharge` removes the document instead, because no
  status value in the kernel means "completed and absorbed".
- The executing skill MUST NOT edit a code file on this track.
- The executing skill MUST NOT execute a feature file or an example on this track.
  Readiness rests on a test-run report in the branch, a scenario body that
  records the confirmation, or the user's confirmation at the gate; the runtime
  infers none. Scope adds `scenario` and `journey` documents only when
  `skills/_shared/actor-subject-compatibility.md` returned `yes`.
- Each `budget` knob is the per-gate maximum, reached only in expert
  invocation; in auto mode every question draws from the shared
  per-invocation ceiling in `skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md`.
  Per-document confirmations follow the `actualize.fix` model —
  confirmations, not budget questions [assumption]. WHEN both a merge update
  and a status transition apply to one document, the executing skill SHOULD
  combine them into one confirmation exchange ("update and accept?"), so a
  document costs at most one exchange per run. Writes proposed at
  `closeout.capture` take one batched preview question for the whole set,
  counted against the ceiling (`skills/_shared/durable-context-selection.md`).
- In auto mode, spend the remaining ceiling on `closeout.discharge` removal
  confirmations before the capture preview and the experience offer.
  IF the ceiling leaves no question for a removal confirmation, THEN retain
  that plan and name the question ceiling as the reason.

## Track state

[assumption] This track produces no draft artifact, so no `archcore:track`
state block persists between invocations. An interrupted run restarts at
`closeout.verify`; the executing skill MUST NOT re-ask a question or
confirmation already answered earlier in the same invocation. Accepted
answers and confirmations persist only in the running report; the
draft-artifact write-back in `skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md` does
not apply on this track.

### gate: closeout.verify

- Purpose: Establish that the branch work fulfills the plan — judge every
  plan task and acceptance criterion against the current working tree,
  branch diff, and available verification reports. WHEN the
  scoped plan carries a `## Declared Delta` section, judge each declared Δ
  entry against the branch diff too. A document-versus-code direction takes
  its label vocabulary from `skills/_shared/verdict-contract.md`.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: the branch scope matches no `plan` document — the merge and
    accept gates run over the diff-matched documents alone.
  - The branch work boundary resolves per `skills/_shared/branch-state.md`.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: a plan task or acceptance criterion cannot be judged fulfilled
    or unfulfilled from the diff and the codebase.
  - taxonomy: Completion Signals, Functional Scope & Behavior from
    `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 2
- Produces: none — the per-task verdicts land in the running report.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: every plan task and acceptance criterion in scope carries one
    verdict — fulfilled, unfulfilled, or not judgeable from the diff; a
    not-judgeable verdict cites the specific check attempted.
  - blocking: every unfulfilled verdict cites its evidence — the missing
    change, the failing check, or the absent file.
  - blocking: WHEN the scoped plan carries a `## Declared Delta` section,
    every declared Δ entry carries one verdict — confirmed by the diff, or
    missing with its evidence; undeclared change found at this gate is
    appended to the report as unplanned Δ.
  - advisory: readiness — every example of each scoped `scenario` carries one result: run, confirmed, or unconfirmed; a user confirmation is recorded in the running report.
  - advisory: coverage — every Normative Behavior clause of each scoped `spec` with no example in its Conformance block, in a `scenario` that `depends_on` it, or in a feature file it cites is listed by clause number; a cited feature file absent from the branch, and a feature file on the branch that no scoped `spec` cites, are listed by path.
  - advisory: a scoped `scenario` whose `Anchors:` paths changed in the diff carries a verdict per `skills/_shared/verdict-contract.md`.
  - advisory: the report ends with a one-line count summary per verdict.
- Next: `closeout.merge`.

### gate: closeout.merge

- Purpose: Bring the scoped documents up to the implemented reality — merge
  the branch result into the documents that describe it.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: no scoped document's claims diverge from the branch result.
  - The scope — the branch-state boundary plus matched documents — is
    recorded in the running report.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: a document update awaits its per-document confirmation.
  - taxonomy: Terminology & Consistency, Misc / Placeholders from
    `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`. [assumption]
  - budget: 1 question per document awaiting an update [assumption] —
    mirrors the `actualize.fix` per-document confirmation rule.
- Produces: none — the gate updates existing documents via
  `update_document`; it creates no document.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: every `update_document` call was preceded by the user's
    confirmation of that document's update.
  - blocking: the executing skill modified no code file.
  - advisory: declined updates appear in the final report with their
    divergence evidence.
- Next: `closeout.accept`.

### gate: closeout.accept

- Purpose: Transition the confirmed documents of the completed work from
  draft to accepted.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: no scoped document carries `status: draft`.
  - `closeout.verify` recorded its verdicts, or was skipped with the
    diff-matched scope recorded.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: a draft document awaits its status confirmation.
  - taxonomy: Completion Signals from `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 1 question per draft document in scope [assumption] — the offer
    names the document and its verify verdict; for a `scenario` the offer also
    names that scenario's readiness result from `closeout.verify`.
- Produces: none — the gate updates the status field via `update_document`;
  it creates no document.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: every status transition was confirmed for that specific
    document; a decline leaves the status unchanged.
  - blocking: no status transition targets a document whose recorded verify
    verdict is unfulfilled.
  - blocking: no status transition targets a document that carries an
    `archcore:track` state block; the report names its gate, its `deferred`
    entries, and the resume command per `skills/_shared/gate-contract.md`.
  - blocking: no status transition targets an `rfc`; the report names
    `/archcore:document decision` to resolve it.
  - blocking: the executing skill modified no code file.
  - advisory: the final report groups documents by transition applied,
    declined, and skipped.
  - advisory: the final report lists each discharge candidate per the
    Discharge report section in this file, or states that no candidate
    exists.
- Next: `closeout.capture`.

### gate: closeout.capture

- Purpose: Select the durable context of the completed work — the plan's
  claims no other document holds, plus the unplanned Δ — and route each unit
  the user authorizes to the instrument that owns its type, before the plan
  leaves the corpus. The selection follows
  `skills/_shared/durable-context-selection.md`.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: the branch scope matches no `plan` document — the `review`
    skill runs the same selection from its own step 3 instead.
  - `closeout.accept` completed its transitions, or was skipped.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the selection proposes at least one write; the batched preview
    is this gate's one question.
  - taxonomy: Completion Signals, Constraints & Tradeoffs from
    `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 1
- Produces:
  - type: `spec`, `doc`, `guide`, or `scenario` through `skills/_shared/tracks/describe.md`; `adr` and its standard cascade through `skills/_shared/tracks/decision.md`; `cpat`, `task-type`, or `guide` per `skills/_shared/tracks/experience.md`; each per the Write routing of `skills/_shared/durable-context-selection.md`
  - status: draft
  - relations: per the Produces field of the instrument that ran.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: every selected unit is recorded as created, updated, omitted,
    deferred, or declined; a decline names its reason and blocks nothing
    downstream.
  - blocking: every write was authorized at the preview before the call.
  - blocking: no `plan` was created at this gate — the decision instrument's
    architecture cascade is out of scope here.
  - blocking: no document created at this gate was offered for acceptance in
    this invocation.
  - blocking: the executing skill modified no code file.
- Next: `closeout.discharge`.

### gate: closeout.discharge

- Purpose: Remove the completed `plan` from the corpus.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: the branch scope matches no `plan` document; or a task or
    acceptance criterion of that plan carries a verdict other than fulfilled. The gate
    names the unmet condition in the report and exits.
  - A staged, unstaged, or untracked plan follows the same completion and
    confirmation checks as a committed plan.
  - `closeout.verify` recorded a verdict for every plan task and acceptance
    criterion in scope.
  - `closeout.capture` recorded an outcome for every selected unit, or was
    skipped.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: a plan awaits its removal confirmation.
    Before requesting confirmation, state whether git history preserves
    the plan's current content. If the content is not preserved, explain
    that removal loses that version and that git cannot restore it.
  - taxonomy: Completion Signals from `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 1
- Produces: none — the gate removes a document via `remove_document`; it
  creates none.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: every `remove_document` call was preceded by the user's
    confirmation naming that specific plan.
  - blocking: `remove_document` targeted only `plan` documents at this gate.
  - blocking: the executing skill modified no code file.
  - advisory: the report names each removed plan, the units written at
    `closeout.capture` or their absence, and any verified recovery commit.
    If no commit preserves the removed version, state that explicitly.
  - blocking: the report names each retained scoped plan and its reason:
    unfulfilled work with the remaining tasks, insufficient evidence with
    the missing check, declined confirmation, or a removal failure.
- Next: exit — after all matched plans finish closeout, the `review` skill
  runs the repeated-pattern offer once per `skills/_shared/tracks/experience.md`.

## Discharge report

Report only, `plan` excepted. WHEN `closeout.accept` completes its status
transitions, the executing skill MUST list the discharge candidates in the
final report — the scoped documents whose unique information is absorbed
elsewhere — per these type defaults:

- `spec` and `adr` stay canon; neither is ever a discharge candidate.
- A completed `plan` is never a report candidate: `closeout.capture` routes
  its durable units to the owning instruments and `closeout.discharge` removes the
  document, both in the same invocation.
- A `prd` holds until its success metrics verify.
- An `idea` becomes a candidate after `closeout.accept` transitions every
  document that implements it.
- A spike `rnd` keeps only its Findings section.

Only `plan` leaves the corpus on this track, because a completed plan's
statements belong to the `spec` it implements, to the branch commits, and to
whatever `closeout.capture` wrote — nothing unique survives the work.
Every other type keeps its residual value. The `archived` status value does not exist in the kernel;
WHILE that value is absent, the executing skill MUST NOT apply a discharge
transition to a `prd`, an `idea`, an `rnd`, or a `research`, and the report leaves each such
candidate's status unchanged for the user's later action.
