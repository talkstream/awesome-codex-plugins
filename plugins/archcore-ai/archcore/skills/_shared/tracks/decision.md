# Decision Track — Classify, Record as ADR or RFC, Offer a Cascade

Plugin runtime asset. Loaded by the `document` skill (primary executor) and by
the `plan` and `review` skills when their routing resolves to this track. Gate
records and track state follow `skills/_shared/gate-contract.md`; interview
mechanics follow `skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md`.

## Track notes

- Stages: `decision.classify` → `decision.adr` | `decision.rfc` → `decision.cascade`;
  a standard request over an existing local `adr` goes from `decision.classify`
  to `decision.cascade` directly.
- Resolution entry: `decision.resolve` is a second entry point on an existing
  `rfc` draft ("resolve the RFC", "we accepted the proposal"), outside the
  classify chain; its accepted verdict rejoins the chain at `decision.cascade`.
- Ported from the pre-cutover `decide` skill (`skills/decide/SKILL.md` and
  `skills/decide/references/continuations.md`), removed at cutover; "the source"
  in this file names those files.
- Track question maximum: 4 on the classify chain. The per-gate split
  (classify 1, adr 2, rfc 2, cascade 1) follows the weight of the source
  questions [assumption]; the resolution entry adds `decision.resolve` with
  budget 1 outside that chain. Each
  `budget` knob is the per-gate maximum, reached only in expert invocation; in
  auto mode every question draws from the shared per-invocation ceiling in
  `skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md`.
- Global matches: when the duplicate check in `decision.classify` matches a
  global document (`source_kind: "global"`), the executing skill loads
  `skills/_shared/globals.md`, records the decision as a local document that
  refines or overrides the global, and never modifies the global or targets it
  with `add_relation`. This constraint binds every relation in this track.
  Absent any global match, the track proceeds as usual.
- Cascade question: the source offered the cpat opt-in as a separate question;
  this track merges that offer into the `decision.cascade` gate's single
  cascade-choice question to hold that gate's budget at 1 [assumption].

### gate: decision.classify

- Purpose: Select the branch — settled decision (`decision.adr`), open proposal (`decision.rfc`), or a standard over an existing decision (`decision.cascade`).
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: the subject text names the target type `adr` or `rfc` — the named type selects the branch.
  - The request describes one technical decision, proposal, or standard.
  - WHEN the request carries no standard signal, `list_documents(types=["adr", "rfc"])` is checked for local documents on this topic (global matches: see Track notes): none → proceed; a local `adr` the request would replace ("switch to", "replace", "we moved to") → record it as the replaced decision; a local `adr` that already records the same choice → report it and exit without a write; an open `rfc` draft → `decision.resolve` when a verdict is stated, otherwise the trigger below fires.
  - WHEN the request carries a standard signal — "make it our standard", "we should always", "developers must", or the type `rule` in the subject — no `rfc` records the topic and at most one local `adr` does; that `adr` becomes the upstream of the standard cascade. IF two or more local `adr` documents match, THEN the trigger below fires and asks which one the standard follows.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: two or more local `adr` documents match a standard request; or an open `rfc` draft on the topic exists and no verdict is stated — ask whether to resolve that `rfc` or record a separate decision; or the request does not state whether the decision is settled, or open-proposal wording ("thinking about", "should we", "proposing", "design proposal") appears — confirm the RFC branch before routing.
  - taxonomy: Constraints & Tradeoffs, Completion Signals from `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 1
- Produces: none — the `decision.adr` and `decision.rfc` gates produce the document.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the recorded outcome names `decision.adr`, `decision.rfc`, `decision.cascade`, `decision.resolve`, or the existing `adr` that already records the choice.
- Next: `decision.resolve` when an open `rfc` draft on the topic exists and a verdict is stated or chosen; exit when a local `adr` already records the same choice; `decision.cascade` with the standard cascade selected when the request carries standard signals and one local `adr` on the topic exists; `decision.adr` when the decision is settled, when no answer marks it open (the default), or when standard signals appear and no local `adr` exists; `decision.rfc` when the user confirms the proposal is open.

### gate: decision.adr

- Purpose: Compose and create the ADR for a settled decision per `skills/_shared/adr-contract.md` and `skills/_shared/precision-rules.md`.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: `decision.classify` selected `decision.rfc`.
  - The request, recorded clarifications, or an `rnd` or `research` covering the topic state the specific choice (version or name), the considered alternatives with rejection reasons, and the conditions that would invalidate the decision.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the coverage scan returns `Missing` on a named category — the decision lacks a specific choice, named alternatives with rejection reasons, or invalidation conditions.
  - taxonomy: Constraints & Tradeoffs, Completion Signals from `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md` [assumption].
  - budget: 2
- Produces:
  - type: adr
  - status: draft
  - relations: evaluate the decision's inputs and consumers through `skills/_shared/relation-authoring.md`; use `depends_on` for an investigation the decision relies on, and `related` for a justified joint reading task; `supersedes` → the local `adr` that `decision.classify` recorded as replaced. A shared topic alone creates no edge.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the draft carries every section that `skills/_shared/adr-contract.md` requires.
- Next: `decision.cascade`.

### gate: decision.rfc

- Purpose: Compose and create the RFC for an open proposal, for team review before a decision is made.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: `decision.classify` selected `decision.adr`.
  - The request states the proposed change and the problem it solves.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the request does not state the proposed change or the problem it solves.
  - taxonomy: Functional Scope & Behavior, Constraints & Tradeoffs from `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md` [assumption].
  - budget: 2
- Produces:
  - type: rfc
  - status: draft
  - relations: rfc `extends` the past ADR it revises, when one exists; rfc `related` the idea that inspired it, when one exists.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the draft covers Summary, Motivation, Detailed Design, Drawbacks, and Alternatives.
- Next: `decision.cascade` — that gate's skip_when ends the track on this branch.

### gate: decision.resolve

- Purpose: Resolve an open `rfc` — record the verdict and route acceptance into the ADR path.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: no `rfc` draft covers the topic — a fresh decision request belongs to `decision.classify`.
  - The request names a resolution intent for an existing proposal — "resolve the RFC", "we accepted the proposal", "reject the RFC".
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the request does not state the verdict — accepted, rejected, or still open.
  - taxonomy: Completion Signals, Constraints & Tradeoffs from `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 1
- Produces:
  - type: adr — on the accepted verdict only; the rejected and still-open verdicts produce no document. Composed per `skills/_shared/adr-contract.md` and `skills/_shared/precision-rules.md`, mapping the rfc's Motivation → Context, Detailed Design → Decision, Alternatives → Alternatives Considered, and Drawbacks → Consequences.
  - status: draft
  - relations: adr `extends` the resolved `rfc`.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the recorded verdict names accepted, rejected, or still open.
  - blocking: WHEN the verdict is accepted, the adr exists with `extends` → the rfc, carries every section `skills/_shared/adr-contract.md` requires, and the rfc status is `accepted`.
  - blocking: WHEN the verdict is rejected, the rfc status is `rejected` and no adr was created.
  - blocking: WHEN the verdict is still open, no document was modified.
- Next: `decision.cascade` on the accepted verdict; exit otherwise.

### gate: decision.cascade

- Purpose: Offer the continuation cascade that matches the ADR — standard (rule + guide) or architecture (spec + plan) — and create the documents the user confirms, per `skills/_shared/precision-rules.md`, `skills/_shared/rule-contract.md` (rule), `skills/_shared/spec-contract.md` (spec), and `skills/_shared/guide-contract.md` (guide).
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: the track produced an `rfc`, or the ADR content matches neither signal set below — the ADR alone is a valid endpoint.
  - An ADR draft produced by `decision.adr` exists, or `decision.classify` selected one local `adr` as the upstream of a standard request.
  - Standard-cascade signals — the decision describes enforceable behavior: "we should always", "developers must", "the team should", "going forward all X must Y".
  - Architecture-cascade signals — the decision establishes or changes a boundary contract (API, interface, schema, protocol) or a feature or subsystem with states, field-driven rules, and invariants: "the X system will provide", "the contract is", "the interface exposes", "the API will be", "the feature must behave", "the states are".
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: no recorded user confirmation of a cascade exists — request wording or a recorded clarification that names the cascade counts as the confirmation; when confirmation is absent, one question offers the matching cascade; when both signal sets match, that question asks which cascade fits (standard, architecture, or neither for now); when the decision describes a before/after code-pattern shift, the question's option list includes "standard + cpat" alongside "standard", "architecture", and "neither for now".
  - taxonomy: Constraints & Tradeoffs, Integration & External Dependencies, Completion Signals from `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md` [assumption].
  - budget: 1
- Produces:
  - type: rule and guide (standard cascade), or spec and plan (architecture cascade); when the decision describes a before/after code-pattern shift, the executing skill MAY create a cpat before the rule.
  - status: draft
  - relations: rule `implements` adr; guide `related` rule; spec `implements` adr; plan `implements` spec; cpat `implements` adr; rule `related` cpat.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: every cascade document was created after a recorded user confirmation (request wording that names the cascade counts), never before.
  - blocking: every created cascade document carries its relation from the Produces list.
  - blocking: each created rule carries every section that `skills/_shared/rule-contract.md` requires; each created spec carries every section that `skills/_shared/spec-contract.md` requires.
  - blocking: each created guide carries every section `skills/_shared/guide-contract.md` requires; each created plan covers Goal, Tasks, Acceptance Criteria, Dependencies; each created cpat covers What Changed, Why, Before, After, Scope.
  - blocking: WHEN the architecture cascade creates a spec, the spec passes the user-owned choice check of `sdd.design` (`skills/_shared/tracks/sdd.md`) before the plan is created; a failed check keeps the spec's state block and creates no plan.
  - advisory: WHEN grounding surfaced a concrete file or module for a plan task, the created plan annotates that task with `@path` notation — parity with the plan skill's task-mapping step.
  - advisory: the closing report lists document paths, relation edges, and one recommended next action.
- Next: exit.
