# SDD Track — Concept, Intent, Contract, Decompose, Runbook Instruments

Plugin runtime asset. Loaded by the `plan` skill (primary executor) when the
conductor (`skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`) invokes an instrument this file
hosts. Gate execution, state block, and resume rules:
`skills/_shared/gate-contract.md`. Interview mechanics and question ceilings:
`skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md`. Coverage categories:
`skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`. Per-type content contracts:
`skills/_shared/prd-contract.md` (`prd`) and
`skills/_shared/spec-contract.md` (`spec`).

## Track notes

- This file hosts six instruments the conductor invokes individually:
  concept → `idea` at `sdd.frame`, intent → `prd` at `sdd.require`,
  contract → `spec` at `sdd.design`, illustrate → `scenario` at
  `sdd.illustrate`, decompose → `plan` at `sdd.decompose`,
  runbook → `guide` at `sdd.runbook`.
- Under the illustrate condition of `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`,
  `sdd.require` also produces a `journey` beside the `prd` — a recorded
  exception to single-type production, on the pattern of `decision.cascade`.
  No `/archcore:document` mode reaches `sdd.require`.
- Both actor-subject types are gated on
  `skills/_shared/actor-subject-compatibility.md`; the conductor runs the probe
  before invoking either production.
- `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md` owns the sequence between instruments; no
  gate here chains into another instrument — each gate exits to the conductor.
- Each `budget` knob states this track's per-gate maximum, reached only in
  expert invocation. Auto mode draws every question from the shared
  per-invocation ceiling in `skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md`.
- Content voice for produced documents: `skills/_shared/precision-rules.md`
  Rule 6.
- Before the first gate, the `plan` skill calls `list_documents` for the types
  `idea`, `prd`, `rnd`, `mrd`, `brd`, `urd`, `spec`, `plan`, and `guide` —
  plus `research` when `skills/_shared/research-compatibility.md` returned
  `yes` — and checks the topic for duplicates and recorded discovery.
- WHEN a `brd` or `urd` covers the topic, `sdd.require` composes Goals and
  Success Metrics from the `brd`'s success metrics and Requirements from the
  `urd`'s acceptance criteria — recorded requirements are never re-asked.
- WHEN a check-existing search returns a global document (`source_kind:
  "global"`), the executing skill loads `skills/_shared/globals.md`.
  WHEN no result is global, the gates proceed unchanged.
- The `task-type` offer that followed the plan in the source feature flow
  belongs to the experience track (`skills/_shared/tracks/experience.md`),
  not to `sdd`.
- A route can produce several documents on one topic through these
  instruments. The content-kind ownership table in
  `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md` names the one document that owns each kind
  of statement; the `sdd.require`, `sdd.design`, and `sdd.decompose` exit
  checks apply it.
- [assumption] Taxonomy knob values are mapped from each source step's
  composed sections; the source flows predate
  `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
- Per-type content contracts for the actor-subject types:
  `skills/_shared/scenario-contract.md` (`scenario`) and
  `skills/_shared/journey-contract.md` (`journey`).

### gate: sdd.frame

- Purpose: Establish the core concept, its beneficiary, and known risks — the
  framing the later gates implement.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: an `idea`, `prd`, `rnd`, or `research` covering the topic
    exists in `.archcore/` — an `rnd`'s Recommendation or a `research`'s
    Synthesis frames the topic the way an `idea` does; a complete sources set (`mrd`, `brd`, `urd`) on the topic
    also closes this gate — the `urd` records the concept's beneficiary.
  - The conductor invokes this gate per sequencing rule 2 of
    `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md` (the high-uncertainty portfolio).
  - The request text names the core concept and who benefits from it.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the request does not name the core concept or the beneficiary.
  - taxonomy: Functional Scope & Behavior, Constraints & Tradeoffs from
    `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 3
- Produces:
  - type: idea
  - status: draft
  - relations: none
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the idea draft contains the sections Idea, Value, Possible
    Implementation, and Risks and Constraints.
- Next: exit — the conductor names the next instrument per
  `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`.

### gate: sdd.require

- Purpose: Establish the problem, goals, success metrics, and requirements as
  a `prd` scoped to one unit of product decision — a whole product or a
  single feature; size never changes the type.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: a `prd` covering the topic exists in `.archcore/`; or the
    request is feature-scoped and an `idea`, `rnd`, `research`, or `adr`
    covering the topic already records the problem and the goals — the compression path in
    `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md`.
  - The concept and beneficiary are recorded — in an `idea`, `rnd`, or
    `research` document, in a `urd` or `srs` covering the topic (recorded requirement
    sources), under `## Clarifications`, or in the request text.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the problem statement or the success metrics are not recorded.
  - taxonomy: Functional Scope & Behavior, Interaction & UX Flow,
    Non-Functional Quality Attributes, Completion Signals from
    `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 5
- Produces:
  - type: prd; additionally journey under the illustrate condition of
    `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`, composed per
    `skills/_shared/journey-contract.md`
  - status: draft
  - relations: `implements` → the `idea` from `sdd.frame`; none when no
    `idea` exists. `related` → the `mrd`, `brd`, and `urd` on the topic, when
    they exist. A product-level `prd` additionally links each feature-scoped
    `prd` it covers. `related` from the journey → the `prd`, when both are
    produced.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the prd draft contains every mandatory section defined in
    `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md`.
  - blocking: WHEN a journey is produced, it contains the sections Intent,
    Actors, Journeys, and Open Questions per `skills/_shared/journey-contract.md`.
  - blocking: every numbered requirement in the prd draft follows the
    requirement form in `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md`.
  - blocking: no statement in the prd draft belongs to another document under
    the content-kind ownership table in `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md`.
  - advisory: a feature-scoped prd draft holds the body target the scope rule
    in `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md` sets; a product-level prd carries no
    line target.
- Next: exit — the conductor names the next instrument per
  `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`.

### gate: sdd.design

- Purpose: Formalize the behavior consumers rely on as a `spec` implementing
  the `prd`, and edit the `prd` statements this `spec` takes over — this gate
  calls `update_document` on the `prd` as well as creating the `spec`, per
  ownership rule 2 in `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md`.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: a `spec` covering the capability this invocation designs exists
    in `.archcore/` without an open `sdd.design` state block, or no consumer
    relies on the planned behavior as a contract, per the routing gate in
    `skills/_shared/spec-contract.md`.
  - The conductor invokes this gate per its instrument-registry entry in
    `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md` — one invocation per capability.
  - A `prd` on the topic exists, or `sdd.require` closed through the
    compression path in `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md` and the `idea`,
    `rnd`, `research`, or `adr` that closed it records the problem and the goals.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the dependents, the surface, the constraints and invariants, or
    the failure behaviors are not recorded; or a material draft claim relies
    only on a similar precedent or conflicts with applicable grounding.
  - taxonomy: Domain & Data Model, Integration & External Dependencies, Edge
    Cases & Failure Handling, Constraints & Tradeoffs from
    `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 3
- Produces:
  - type: spec
  - status: draft
  - relations: `implements` → the `prd` from `sdd.require`. When no `prd`
    exists, use `implements` → the `idea` or `adr` whose requirements the spec
    fulfils, or `depends_on` → the `rnd` or `research` whose findings the spec
    relies on. Check the compression-path claim through
    `skills/_shared/relation-authoring.md`; research is not an implementation target.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the spec draft contains every mandatory section defined in
    `skills/_shared/spec-contract.md`.
  - blocking: no line in the spec draft restates a prd requirement; the
    content-kind ownership table in `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md` assigns
    each statement to one document.
  - blocking: WHEN this spec took over a prd statement, the executing skill
    edited that statement in the prd per ownership rule 2 of
    `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md`, in one `update_document` call.
  - advisory: compare the draft's scope, surface, normative behavior,
    invariants, failure behavior, and conformance with the request and
    applicable grounding; report material omissions, contradictions, and
    unsupported claims by section, and correct those the evidence resolves.
  - blocking: every material `user`-source choice that changes normative
    behavior, an invariant, or failure behavior is answered by the request or
    a recorded clarification, or recorded as delegated under
    `## Clarifications` and marked `[assumption]` in the draft; otherwise keep
    this gate open and report per the stopped-gate rule in
    `skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md`. A blocked gate cannot advance to
    `sdd.decompose`.
  - advisory: each Normative Behavior clause of the spec draft is illustrated by
    one example — in its Conformance block, in a `scenario` that `depends_on`
    it, or in a feature file it cites by `@path`; the closing report lists the
    clauses with none.
- Next: exit — the conductor names the next instrument per
  `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`. WHEN an answer at this gate settles a
  choice between technical alternatives, record it via the decision track
  (`skills/_shared/tracks/decision.md`).

### gate: sdd.illustrate

- Purpose: Illustrate the clauses of the `spec` designed at `sdd.design` with
  the actor's flows and concrete examples, as a `scenario` composed per
  `skills/_shared/scenario-contract.md`.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: a `scenario` that `depends_on` the designed `spec` exists in
    `.archcore/`, or the capability does not meet the illustrate condition of
    `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`, or
    `skills/_shared/actor-subject-compatibility.md` did not return `yes`.
  - The conductor invokes this gate per its instrument-registry entry in
    `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md` — one invocation per capability, after
    that capability's `sdd.design`.
  - The designed `spec` carries numbered Normative Behavior clauses.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the actors, one concrete example per illustrated clause, or the
    anchoring files are not recorded in the `spec`, the `prd`, the `journey`,
    or `## Clarifications`.
  - taxonomy: Interaction & UX Flow, Edge Cases & Failure Handling from
    `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 2
- Produces:
  - type: scenario
  - status: draft
  - relations: `depends_on` → the `spec` from `sdd.design`; `implements` → the
    `journey` on the topic, when one exists; between the parts of a split by actor,
    `related` only where `skills/_shared/relation-authoring.md` supports the claim.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the scenario draft contains the sections Subject, Actors, Flows,
    Examples, and Open Questions per `skills/_shared/scenario-contract.md`.
  - blocking: every clause number cited in Subject exists in the designed `spec`.
  - blocking: every Flows subsection opens with an `Anchors:` line.
  - blocking: the draft is within the body cap of
    `skills/_shared/scenario-contract.md`, or was split by actor with the
    remainder reported.
  - advisory: WHEN a `journey` on the topic exists, the journey was edited down
    to intent for the flows this scenario took over, per ownership rule 2 of
    `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md`.
- Next: exit — the conductor names the next instrument per
  `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`.

### gate: sdd.decompose

- Purpose: Decompose the recorded scope into a phased `plan` with acceptance
  criteria and dependencies, composed from upstream drafts, recorded
  clarifications, and matching `task-type` or `cpat` precedent surfaced by
  grounding — a matching `task-type`'s Steps seed the task breakdown.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: a `plan` covering the topic exists in `.archcore/`.
  - A `prd` or a `spec` on the topic exists.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: none — the executing skill MUST NOT ask questions at this gate.
  - taxonomy: none.
  - budget: 0
- Produces:
  - type: plan
  - status: draft
  - relations: `implements` → the `spec` from `sdd.design` when it exists;
    `implements` → the `prd` from `sdd.require` otherwise.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the plan draft contains the sections Goal, Tasks (phased),
    Acceptance Criteria, and Dependencies.
  - blocking: no plan task and no acceptance criterion restates a prd
    requirement, a prd success metric, or a spec behavior line; the
    content-kind ownership table in `skills/_shared/prd-contract.md` assigns
    each statement to one document.
  - blocking: the plan draft carries a `## Declared Delta` section recording
    the declared Δ and the route rationale, per sequencing rule 9 of
    `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`.
  - advisory: the closing report lists candidate `add_relation` targets among
    existing `adr`, `rule`, `spec`, and `plan` documents, or states that none
    match.
- Next: exit — the conductor names the next instrument per
  `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`. WHEN decomposition surfaces a capability
  outside the declared Δ, the executing skill revises Δ and re-announces per
  `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md` before continuing.

### gate: sdd.runbook

- Purpose: Compose the operational `guide` for a capability whose delta
  introduces an operational procedure — install, migrate, operate, or verify
  steps.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: the declared Δ introduces no operational procedure, or a
    `guide` covering the procedure exists in `.archcore/`.
  - A `spec` or `plan` draft on the topic exists.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the reader or the step actor of the procedure is not recorded.
  - taxonomy: Edge Cases & Failure Handling, Completion Signals from
    `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 1
- Produces:
  - type: guide
  - status: draft
  - relations: `related` → the `spec` of the covered capability.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the guide draft carries every section
    `skills/_shared/guide-contract.md` requires, composed after reading that
    contract and `skills/_shared/precision-rules.md`.
- Next: exit — the conductor names the next instrument per
  `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`.
