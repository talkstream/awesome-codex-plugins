# Gate Contract — Gate Record Template and Track State Rules

Plugin runtime asset. Loaded by skills (`plan`, `document`, `review`) before
executing a track gate. Also the authoring contract for track files under
`skills/_shared/tracks/`. Routing-signal order and track selection live in the
executing skills, not in this file.

Before a gate writes documents or reviews relations, load
`skills/_shared/relation-authoring.md`. Apply its claim check to relation
candidates and its incident-relation review after meaningful document changes.
Required traceability remains part of the gate's checks.

## Track files

- A track file lives at `skills/_shared/tracks/<track-id>.md`.
- Each gate is one section with the heading `### gate: <track>.<stage>`.

## Entry terms

Gates and executing skills use these terms with one meaning:

- **Expert invocation** — the first word of the command arguments is a mode that
  the command's argument hint lists. A gate budget rises to that gate's maximum
  only under an expert invocation.
- **The request names a type** — the subject text contains a document type slug
  (`adr`, `rfc`, `rule`, `spec`, `doc`, `guide`, `scenario`, `research`, `rnd`,
  `evidence`, and the other registry slugs) as a whole word, in any letter case.
  A description of a document's shape without the slug ("a proposal for review")
  does not name a type.
- **Investigation versus one external material** — supplied text that carries
  findings, a synthesis, or a recommendation is an investigation. A source
  excerpt, a measurement, a transcript, or a vendor document without them is
  one external material.

## Gate record template

A gate record carries these fields in this fixed order. When adding a gate,
copy this template:

```markdown
### gate: <track>.<stage>

- Purpose: <the one outcome this gate settles>
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: <condition under which the executing skill skips this gate>
  - <condition that existing documents or the request text can satisfy>
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: <condition that opens an interview at this gate>
  - taxonomy: <coverage categories from skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md>
  - budget: <maximum questions at this gate>
- Produces:
  - type: <archcore document type>
  - status: draft
  - relations: <relation type and target, or none>
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: <objectively verifiable check>
  - advisory: <objectively verifiable check>
- Next: <next stage, branch conditions, or exit>
```

## Example gate

Non-normative example with placeholder names — live gates stay in their track
files, never copied here.

```markdown
### gate: track.classify

- Purpose: Select the branch this track takes.
- Entry conditions:
  - skip_when: the request names the target branch.
  - The request describes one subject for this track.
- Elicitation knobs:
  - trigger: the request does not settle the branch choice.
  - taxonomy: Constraints & Tradeoffs from `skills/_shared/coverage-taxonomy.md`.
  - budget: 1
- Produces: none — a later gate produces the document.
- Exit checks:
  - blocking: the recorded outcome names one branch gate.
- Next: `track.branch-a` when the choice is settled; `track.branch-b` otherwise.
```

## Track state block

The executing skill records track state as one HTML comment inside the draft
artifact, identified by the marker `archcore:track`:

```markdown
<!-- archcore:track
track: <track-id>
gate: <track>.<stage>
route: <computed route and size label per skills/_shared/delta-routing.md>
delta: <declared Δ fields per skills/_shared/delta-routing.md>
taxonomy: <coverage categories already covered by accepted answers>
asked: <questions already asked in this track>
budget: <remaining per-gate budget under an expert invocation; informational>
deferred: <one entry per unresolved question: the question, its reason (budget, interrupted, or later gate), and the behavior it affects>
-->
```

The `budget` field never reduces a later invocation's question ceiling: each
invocation starts a fresh ceiling per `skills/_shared/elicitation-contract.md`.

The `route` and `delta` fields are written by the `plan` skill's conductor
(`skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`); a skill that runs a track outside a
computed route omits both fields. A `plan`-skill resume that finds them
absent follows the conductor's resume rules; every other skill resumes per
this file alone.

The research track may append `artifact_type: research|rnd|evidence` after
`deferred`. The field is optional on older artifacts and absent on other tracks.
On resume, the filename type supplies a missing value. A recorded value that
contradicts the filename is a blocking state error; do not convert the document.

### Evidence operations inside a gate

The research gather gate may create evidence and relation edges before its
single gate-close update. Before creating dependent evidence, it may persist
pending paths and edges in the parent draft's `deferred` field. This checkpoint
is an exception to gate-close-only persistence, not an extra gate close.
Standalone evidence carries its own state and needs no parent draft. Its request
satisfies frame, so the missing-upstream resume rule does not create an
investigation. Failure recovery and edge ordering belong to
`skills/_shared/tracks/research.md`.

### State lifecycle

1. The draft artifact is the only carrier of track state.
2. The executing skill MUST NOT hold track state in session memory or in a side file.
3. WHEN a gate closes, the executing skill MUST persist accepted answers and the state block in one `update_document` call.
4. WHEN all blocking exit checks pass, the executing skill MUST advance the `gate` field to the next stage.
5. WHEN the track exits, the executing skill MUST remove the state block from the artifact.
6. IF a blocking exit check stops the gate, THEN the executing skill MUST persist accepted answers and the state block with the current `gate` in one `update_document` call.

On a computed route, the track exits at the route's last instrument, per
sequencing rule 15 in `skills/_shared/delta-routing.md`.

Import exception: before the confirmed plan exists, keep preview rows in the
session. Tier `S` keeps its row results in the session through closing and
restarts assessment after interruption. Do not create a plan, state block, or
side file for this bookkeeping. Plan-backed imports follow the lifecycle above.

## Execution rules at a gate

1. WHEN a gate opens, the executing skill MUST evaluate `skip_when` before any other gate step, except at a gate that resume rule 7 selects.
2. WHEN existing documents or the request text satisfy a gate's entry conditions, the executing skill MUST NOT treat that fact alone as a reason to skip the gate's elicitation checks.
3. WHEN a gate produces a document, the executing skill MUST create it with `status: draft` via `create_document`.
4. WHEN a gate produces a document, the executing skill MUST check the draft against Rules 1, 7, and 8 of `skills/_shared/precision-rules.md`.
5. IF the draft departs from those rules, THEN the executing skill MUST report each departure as an advisory finding.
6. IF an advisory exit check fails, THEN the executing skill MUST report the finding.
7. IF an advisory exit check fails, THEN the executing skill MUST proceed to the next gate.
8. IF a blocking exit check fails, THEN the executing skill MUST stop at the current gate.
9. IF a blocking exit check fails, THEN the executing skill MUST report the failed check.
10. WHEN a gate's `skip_when` holds, the executing skill MUST continue at the gate that gate's `Next` field names, unless the skip_when text itself states a different route — `skip_when` skips one gate, never the track.

Rules 4 and 5 are why no gate carries a prose check of its own: the forbidden
lexicon, the line form a type takes, and the open-list prohibition bind every
produced document, and authoring rule 5 below forbids restating a shared
contract inside a gate. A gate states only what is specific to it.

## Resume rules

1. WHEN a skill opens a draft that carries a state block, the skill MUST resume at the earliest gate whose exit checks have not passed.
2. WHILE resuming, the executing skill MUST NOT re-ask a question recorded in `asked` or answered under `## Clarifications`.
3. IF the state block names a stage absent from the track file, THEN the executing skill MUST resume at the first gate whose entry conditions fail.
4. IF the state block names a stage absent from the track file, THEN the executing skill MUST preserve recorded clarifications.
5. IF an upstream document required by an entry condition is missing, THEN the executing skill MUST route to the earliest gate that produces it.
6. IF an interruption left a question in `asked` without an answer or a delegation, THEN the executing skill MAY re-ask that question within the budget; rule 2 does not apply to it.
7. IF a resumed track's earlier gate fails a blocking exit check on the draft that gate produced, THEN the executing skill MUST resume at that gate even when its `skip_when` holds.
8. IF the state block names a track that the executing command does not run, THEN the executing skill MUST NOT write to that draft.
9. IF the state block names a track that the executing command does not run, THEN the executing skill MUST name the command that resumes it.
10. WHEN a resume finds more than one draft with a state block and the request names none of them, the executing skill MUST list them and ask one question, recommending the most recently modified draft.

Commands that resume a track: `/archcore:plan` — `sdd`, `requirements-cascade`,
`research`, and `decision` as a conductor instrument;
`/archcore:document decision` — `decision`; `/archcore:document code` —
`describe`; `/archcore:document research` — `research`, recommended for an
`evidence` draft; `/archcore:init import` — `import`. The `actualize`,
`closeout`, and `experience` tracks write no state block.

## Authoring rules for track files

1. The track author MUST keep the gate record fields in the template order.
2. The track author MUST declare `skip_when` in every gate.
3. The track author MUST tag every exit check `blocking` or `advisory`.
4. The track author MUST reference a shared contract by path.
5. The track author MUST NOT restate a shared contract's rules inside a gate.
6. IF a gate produces no document, THEN the track author MUST write `- Produces: none` in place of the three subfields. [assumption]
