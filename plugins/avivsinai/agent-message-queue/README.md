# Agent Message Queue (AMQ)

**Messaging between coding agents.**

AMQ lets two coding agents exchange messages through a shared directory.
One agent asks for a review; the other reads the message and replies in the
same thread. Messages are plain files, so the local queue needs no messaging
server or database—and you do not have to relay each request yourself.

Try the queue in a fresh shell on macOS. This example uses two mailbox names;
it does not start agents. [Other installation methods →](INSTALL.md)

```bash
brew install avivsinai/tap/amq
amq init --root .agent-mail/demo --agents alice,bob  # Create two mailboxes for demo.
amq send --root .agent-mail/demo --me alice --to bob --body "Please review the parser."
amq drain --root .agent-mail/demo --me bob --include-body
```

- **Keep the conversation together.** Reply in threads, attach context, and
  route messages between sessions or projects.
- **Know what happened to a message.** Receipts distinguish a queued message
  from one the recipient drained.
- **Bring your own agents.** Use the CLI from agent tools or scripts;
  optional wake notifications prompt running agents to check their inboxes.
- **Keep control of the workflow.** AMQ handles messages. You and your
  orchestration tools own tasks, worktrees, permissions, and merges.

## Getting started

This walkthrough connects **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI** on one machine.
Install both agent CLIs and put `claude` and `codex` on `PATH` first.
Use macOS or Linux; on Windows, use WSL with the Linux binary for this
terminal workflow. Native Windows has a verified subset of queue and adapter
support; see the [platform matrix](INSTALL.md#platform-capability-matrix).

### 1. Install the binary

On macOS:

```bash
brew install avivsinai/tap/amq
```

Or on macOS/Linux, review and run the [installer](scripts/install.sh):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The script installs to a user-local directory without `sudo` and checks the
release checksum before extraction. Confirm the install with `amq --version`.
See [Installation](INSTALL.md) for manual downloads and source builds.

### 2. Install Skill

Install the agent instructions so each agent knows how to use AMQ:

```bash
npx skills add avivsinai/agent-message-queue -g -y
```

Restart the agents after installing. [Other skill installation methods](INSTALL.md)
are available if you do not use npm.

### 3. Set up the project

In the repository where the agents will work:

```bash
amq setup
```

Select the agents and launcher, then confirm the preview. Setup writes the
project configuration and creates the default session and its mailboxes.

### 4. Start both agents

```bash
amq launch
```

The first launch asks you to trust the launch plan. With `tmux`, `cmux`, or
`ghostty`, AMQ starts the agents in that terminal app. With the `commands`
backend, it prints one command per agent and exits with code `6` (action
required). Paste each complete command into a separate terminal; do not
shorten or rebuild it.

Start both agents before sending the first message. Messages that arrive
before a recipient's wake starts remain unread but do not trigger that new
wake. The recipient can still get them with `amq drain --include-body`.

### Control a session from Buzz

Inside a running Claude Code session, type `/amq-remote`; inside Codex, invoke
the skill as `$amq-remote` (Codex does not register `/` commands for skills).
The first
time, import that session's agent into Buzz Desktop. Each session has its own
agent; the ACP model `amq-remote:<name>` selects it. DM that agent from the
Buzz app or Desktop, and the DM runs in that session.
`/amq-remote off` disconnects it. See [amq-remote](cmd/amq-remote/README.md).

### 5. Exchange a message

Ask Claude to run this command through its shell tool:

```bash
amq send --to codex --subject "Hello" --body "Can you see this?"
```

Ask Codex to check its inbox if it has not already responded to the notification:

```bash
amq list --new
amq drain --include-body
```

`list` previews new messages. `drain` reads them, moves them out of the new
inbox, and writes receipts. The output includes the sender and message body.
To reply in the same thread, use the ID from that output:

```bash
amq reply --id "<message-id>" --body "Yes, I can see it."
```

The launched agents already have their identity and session set. You do not
need to repeat `--me` or `--root` inside those sessions.

## How it works

Each agent has an inbox and an outbox under a local queue root. A message
contains a JSON header and a Markdown body. AMQ writes and syncs a temporary
file, then publishes it with a rename: a reader sees a complete message or
no message, not a partly written body.

A session is a separate queue. Routing checks help prevent a shell pinned
to one session from changing another by mistake. A wake notification asks an
agent to check its inbox; it is not evidence that the agent read or completed
the request. See [routing](docs/session-routing.md) and
[message tracing](docs/trace.md) for those contracts.

Optional [priority holds](docs/wake-operations.md#hold-by-priority) can delay
the first notification for routine mail while urgent mail skips the hold. Wake
[live settings](docs/wake-operations.md#live-settings) are stored per agent;
use `amq wake config --me <handle> --hold-normal 5m` to change a running wake.

AMQ is for local agent coordination, not a distributed broker. The optional
[bridge companion](cmd/amq-bridge/README.md) exchanges messages between hosts;
each host keeps control of its own queue.

### Remote

The optional [remote companion](cmd/amq-remote/README.md) connects a running
session to its own Buzz agent. The default path is the session mailbox: a DM
arrives as an AMQ message from `buzz`, and the agent's reply is the answer.
`--native` and the relay are the other paths. It is a separate binary: `amq`
gains no socket. The Homebrew `amq` formula installs `amq`, `amq-acp`, and
`amq-remote`. Commands, flags, and exit codes are in that README. The design is
[the remote-control ADR](docs/adr-remote-control.md); pinned seams are
[the compatibility manifest](docs/remote-compat.md).
